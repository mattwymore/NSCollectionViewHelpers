#SWCollectionViewHorizontalLayout

Still a work in progress. A horizontally-scrolling collection (or rather, each section's content scrolls horzontally). Section headers and footers go above and below the content, as before, and don't scroll.

##Usage

Much like any other layout, import the .h file and set your JNWCollectionView's layout to an instance of SWCollectionViewHorizontal Layout
