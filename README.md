#NSCollectionView Helpers

Being a collection of helper classes for NSCollectionView. Note that this applies to **Mac** applications, **not iOS**. 
The layouts are for use with [JNWCollectionView](https://github.com/jwilling/JNWCollectionView).

- SWCollectionViewStaggeredGridLayout: mimics a Pinterest-style staggered grid
- SWCollectionViewHorizontalLayout: a collection view that scrolls horizontally.
- There are a few classes within SWTouchScrollCollectionView that are related to making various scroll views "touch-scrollable". See the README in that directory for proper usage.
